:set softtabstop=4
to this point you dont need any special command in terminal ..

to be able to use the command PlugInstall in the command bar you have to install curl if you didint installet yet it is good to check it out if it is already installed sudo apt install curl if yes you can run this command

$~ sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim' 

all the plugins are token from git so we have to install git if it is not already installed sudo apt install git

so now you have the function PlugInstall to install the plugins
nice ! so those are the basic plugins really handfull!
